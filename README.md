# Hangman
Hangman game made in Python
 Instead of seeing a person like your typically hangman, you just get six tries to guess a word.
 If your six tries are up, the word you needed to guess is revealed.
 If you guess all the letters then you get to try type the correct word out using the correctly guessed words.

 Future:
 I plan to add more words to the game and a way to tell the user that there are no more vowels to guess.
